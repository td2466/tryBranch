# My comments: (Jialiu Wang)
# There are some concepts/names we must understand before using these tools.
# For the most part, we are using three things:
#   HTML for web pages
#   FLASK for handling database
#   JINJA for generating HTML from templates
#
# HTML uses tags to arrange its contents.
# We are using a lot of different tags, including (but not constrained to):
#   <!--   --> for comments
#   <!DOCTYPE> for document declaration
#   <a>   </a> for hyperlinks
#   <br />     for line breaks
#   <dl>       for definition lists
#       <dd>   </dd>        component of definition lists
#       <dt>   </dt>        component of definition lists
#   </dl>      for definition lists
#   <h1>   </h1>    for headings of different sizes
#   <h2>   </h2>    for headings of different sizes
#   <h3>   </h3>    for headings of different sizes
#   <h4>   </h4>    for headings of different sizes
#   <h5>   </h5>    for headings of different sizes
#   <h6>   </h6>    for headings of different sizes
#   <head>   </head>    for head section of an HTML document
#   <html>   </html>    for the whole HTML document
#   <input />  for various kinds of input field
#   <p>   </p> for a (simple) paragraph
#   <title>   </title>      for the title of page (displayed on top of the browser toolbar)
#   <ul>       for unordered lists
#       <li>   </li>        component of unordered lists
#   </ul>      for unordered lists
# For more information and better understanding on HTML,
# I recommend reading http://www.w3school.com.cn/tags/ (in Chinese)
# and http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ (in English).

# FLASK is a micro webdevelopment framework for Python.
# It is used as an imported class (Flask class as imported in this
# python code).
# `app = Flask(__name__, template_folder=tmpl_dir)`
# So `app` is an instance of Flask class in our code.
# @app.route() is called a route() decorator. A route() decorator
# is used to bind a function to a URL. Inside the parenthesis
# is (generally) the URL which will trigger the corresponding
# function.
# The function that a route() decorator is bound to (of course)
# has a name. The name is called "endpoint" in Flask. Therefore,
# each route() decorator binds a URL with an endpoint function.
# But as programmers, we love variables and using variables to
# achieve fancy things. The URL used in route() decorator
# has variable (or I should call it "dynamic") parts like
# <variable_name>. Such a dynamic name will also be a parameter
# of the endpoint function the (variable) URL binds to.
# Another important usage of Flask is, the url_for() function.
# In our project, url_for() functions can be called from Jinja
# templates and give us the disired URLs. url_for() function
# takes endpoint (name of function) as input.
# Flask is used to generate dynamic HTML pages based on user
# inputs in our project, guide and redirect user from page
# to page, call Jinja to render HTML pages, communicate with
# the database and handle user
# input as in HTML forms. Therefore it is the core part of this
# project.
# Flask can also handle different HTTP methods, which is also
# used in this project.
# For more information and better, comprehensive understanding
# on Flask, I recommend reading
# http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/
# and more documents on Flask documentation site:
# http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/
#
# JINJA is a tool for designing text file templates. It is
# able to generate templates for various kinds of text files
# such as HTML, XML, CSV, LaTeX etc.
# It has variables, statements, comments, control structures
# as a programming language. And more importantly, Jinja has
# a very useful feature called templates inheritance.
# It would be extremely easy to use Jinja to write your own
# templates for structured text files, if you have extensive
# experience on programming.
# Jinja mainly use syntax like {{ item }} to represent
# expressions, {% for ... %} to represent statements (control
# structures). With these in mind, it is very easy to understand
# a template written with Jinja.
